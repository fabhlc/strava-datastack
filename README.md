The purpose of this project is to experiment with new data stack tools I had yet to use,
namely dlt, MotherDuck, and Evidence. I analyze my own Strava fitness data, set goals, and build visualizations
to help me achieve said goals.

## Tools
- Extract+Load --> dlt
- Warehouse --> MotherDuck/DuckDB
- Transform --> dbt
- Storytelling --> evidence

Big thanks to @datadisciple for laying the ground-work for dlt.
